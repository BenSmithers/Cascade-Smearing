# What's the goal here

Use the IceCube data release to get the central expectation

Bring in some light systematics to get uncertainties on this expectation

Develop something that uses these to generate possible measurements around that expectation. We need a prior distribution on each!

Then we need to be able to take sterile fluxes to calculate llh's at each new physics parameter point! 


We need a function that calculates the likelihood of MEASUREMENT given CENTRAL
    - each
